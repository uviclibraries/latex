# Typing Math Equations
If you and your group have any questions, or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance. Have fun!

1.  Try to produce the following equations in LaTeX. Use `\newpage` to make this exercise start on a new page. 
    -   Use [this](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions){:target="_blank"} as a guide. 
    -   To use the amsmath package, type `\usepackage{amsmath}` after `\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}` and above the `\title{Introduction to LaTeX}`.
2.  Check your solutions on the next page (Activity #4).
